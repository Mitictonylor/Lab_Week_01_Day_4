Pair Programming Lab with Gordon, one of my classmate from Codeclan


***Friends Exercise/Lab

**Learning Objectives
Be able to write our own tests
Understand what the setup() method is used for in MiniTest
Using Setup()
Up until now every test we wrote, we instantiated the objects we were testing within our tests.

**LAB

Given a Starting point

We have a bunch of information about a set of friends. We’re going to find out some interesting information about them using TDD.

We need to to complete the tasks in the comments of the friends_spec.rb file. Write your tests in that file first, then write the function to pass the test in friends.rb. There is one example test and function already. If you get stuck, there are hints on how to approach the problem for each question.

A few extra notes…

Firstly, remember we can pass more than one argument into a function and this will need to be done for some of the questions (check for the hints)

Secondly, this is probably the first time where we might not test the return value of a function, but instead check that it’s completed the action we want it to (read the hint for question 4)

Lastly, in the spec file remember to name all your tests with test_ at the start of the function declaration (e.g. def test_getting_name)
